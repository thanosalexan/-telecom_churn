**PART 1: Understanding Customer Churn (Descriptive)**
The first part of the project provides a comprehensive analysis of customer churn in a telecommunications company. It explores the dataset, which includes customer observations and usage details, to identify the variables related to churn. The report examines the importance of variables, the need for transformations, and assesses the model's performance. It discusses assumptions that need careful consideration and presents a detailed explanation of the chosen model, supported by tables and plots.


**PART 2: Predicting Customer Churn in (Predictive)**
The first task of the second part of the project, involves creating a churn prediction model to identify potential churners, focusing solely on prediction and comparing multiple methods. The report discusses the selection of relevant variables and evaluates the predictive abilities of the models. The second task focuses on clustering users based on their usage behavior, without considering churn information, to enable targeted marketing strategies. The report explains the methods employed, variables chosen, and evaluates the prediction and clustering outcomes, providing stakeholders with comprehensive insights for decision making.
